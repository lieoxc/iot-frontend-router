## Project introduction
ThingsPanel is a **lightweight, componentized** open-source IoT application support platform, designed to reduce development efforts and accelerate IoT project construction through reusable plugins.

## Key Plugins
- **Device Function Templates**: Integrates physical models with charts.
- **Device Configuration Templates**: Combines device function templates with protocol plugins.
- **Protocol Access Plugins**: Addresses various protocol access issues.
- **Service Access Plugins**: Allows device access through third-party platforms.
- **Dashboard Cards**: Extends dashboard display capabilities.
- **Visualization Plugins**: Expands functionality for large-screen visualization.
- **Dependency Plugins**: Building blocks for industry solutions.

Using these plugins **repeatedly** can greatly improve R&D efficiency.

2. **Clone the project**.
3. **Install Dependencies**.
  Install Node.js and pnpm:
  `npm install -g pnpm`, 
  Install project dependencies:

4. **Start the Development Server**.
  `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`.
5. **Create a Branch for Development**.
  Pull a branch from the main branch to start development.
6. **Local Code Checking**.
  Code checks will be triggered automatically when committing code, but you can also manually run the checks:
     - `pnpm lint` Run ESLint for code checking;
     - `pnpm typecheck` Run TypeScript type checking;
     - `pnpm format` Format the code.
1. CI/CD with GitHub Actions, 
  **Ensure that the CI/CD checks pass and make necessary modifications if needed**.
2. **Submit a Pull Request**
  After committing code, submit a pull request and wait for review.
3. Merge Code into the Main Branch
  Once the code review is approved, the code will be merged into the main branch.
4. Automatic Deployment
  Code merged into the main branch will be automatically deployed to the production environment.
